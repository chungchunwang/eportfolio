        </motion.span> I am Jason (Chung-chun Wang), a <WavyText>computer engineering</WavyText> student at Georgia Tech with experience in <WavyText>full-stack web development</WavyText>, <WavyText>game development</WavyText>, <WavyText>electronics</WavyText>, and <WavyText>music</WavyText>.

          <br />
          
          Since middle school, programming has fascinated me. Living in a city apartment, I had no access to physical tools to tinker with, but the computer offered me a canvas to make whatever I wanted. So, I fell in love with it.

          <br />
          
          Most coding, in my opinion, is an art that is best taught through <WavyText>self-learning</WavyText> and <WavyText>project experience</WavyText>. Having no curricular computer science classes, I garnered everything I know from online documentation and tutorials. This, I believe, is an asset, because in the process I learned how to study independently, and how to approach learning monolithic topics you know nothing about.
          
          <br />
          
          I started out building simple personal websites, but from there, the sky was the limit. During a summer internship, I independently built a <WavyText>medical signal annotation editor</WavyText> using WebGL. Over another summer, I made <WavyText>VR video games</WavyText> in Unity, including a Beat Saber clone that could play custom maps!
          
          <br />
          
          In my first semester of college, I have eagerly been putting my programming skills to the test and have attended quite a few hackathons. At <WavyText>HackMIT</WavyText>, I won the Suno Track for making a collaborative (like Figma) MIDI editor. At <WavyText>DubHacks</WavyText>, I won first prize in title sponsor Intel&apos;s track with an AI &quot;Spotlight Search&quot; that could get your files semantically.
          
          <br />
          
          I am eager to make more! If you would like to collaborate, please feel free to contact me. You can find all my information by <StyledLink to="/contact">clicking here</StyledLink>.
